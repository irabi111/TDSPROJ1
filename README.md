 Data Scraping:
* User data was retrieved from the GitHub API by applying filters for users located in Melbourne with a follower count exceeding 100, followed by fetching most recently updated repositories.
  
Surprising fact:
* High repository count doesnâ€™t equal high followers; Quality, Relevance, and Networking impact follower growth significantly.
  
  Recommendation for Developers:
* To grow a GitHub following, developers should prioritize relevant, high-quality repositories, contribute to trending projects, and improve visibility through clear documentation.
